<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A <strong>Doubly Linked List</strong> (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called <em>previous pointer</em>, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.<br>
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2014/03/DLL1.png" alt="dll"></p>
<pre><code>public class DLL { 
	Node head; // head of list 
	class Node { 
		int data; 
		Node prev; 
		Node next; 
		Node(int d) { data = d; } 
	} 
} 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Advantages over singly linked list</strong><br>
<strong>1)</strong> A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.<br>
<strong>2)</strong> The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given.<br>
<strong>3)</strong> We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.<br>
In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer.<br>
<strong>Disadvantages over singly linked list</strong><br>
<strong>1)</strong> Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL.<br>
<strong>2)</strong> All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer.</p>
<h3 id="xor-linked-list-–-a-memory-efficient-doubly-linked-list">XOR Linked List – A Memory Efficient Doubly Linked List</h3>
<p>An ordinary Doubly Linked List requires space for two address fields to store the addresses of previous and next nodes. A memory efficient version of Doubly Linked List can be created using only one space for address field with every node. This memory efficient Doubly Linked List is called XOR Linked List or Memory Efficient as the list uses bitwise XOR operation to save space for one address. In the XOR linked list, instead of storing actual memory addresses, every node stores the XOR of addresses of previous and next nodes.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>
<pre><code>1.  Let the node to be deleted be _del_.
2.  If node to be deleted is head node, then change the head pointer to next current head.
    
    if _headnode_ == _del_ then
          _headnode_ =  _del_.nextNode
    
3.  Set _next_ of previous to _del_, if previous to _del_ exists.
    
    if _del_.nextNode != _none_ 
          _del_.nextNode.previousNode = _del_.previousNode 
    
4.  Set _prev_ of next to _del_, if next to _del_ exists.
    
    if _del_.previousNode != _none_ 
          _del_.nextNode.nextNode = _del_.next
