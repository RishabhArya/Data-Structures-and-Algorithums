<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Circular linked list</strong> is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.<br>

<strong>Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:</strong><br>
<strong>1)</strong> Any node can be a starting point.<br>
<strong>2)</strong> Useful for implementation of queue.<br>
<strong>3)</strong> Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list. It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front of the list.<br>
<strong>4)</strong> Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap.</p>
