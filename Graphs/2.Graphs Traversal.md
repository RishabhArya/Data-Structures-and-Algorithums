<h2 id="breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph">Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph</h2>
<p>Breadth First Traversal for a graph is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.<br>

<h2 id="depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph">Depth First Search or DFS for a Graph</h2>
<p>Depth First Traversal  for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, a node may be visited twice. To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> For a weighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.<br>
<strong>2) Detecting cycle in a graph</strong><br>
<strong>3) Path Finding</strong><br>
<strong>4) Topological Sorting</strong><br>
<strong>5) To test if a graph is bipartite</strong><br>
<strong>6) Finding Strongly Connected Components of a graph</strong><br>
<strong>7) Solving puzzles with only one solution</strong></p>
<p>Rule of Hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To find any path, you can use depth-first search. To find a shortest<br>
path, you can use breadth-first search. To find all paths (hence the<br>
number of paths), you can use either of the above and modify to (a)<br>
continue after finding the target node and (b) see if other paths can<br>
reach the target node (though it may have been reached previously).<br>
To  find the path of least weight to the node (in a weighted graph), you<br>
can use Dijkstra’s algorithm (no negative edges), Bellman-Ford<br>
(negative edges OK) or Floyd-Warshall (no negative cycles).</p>
