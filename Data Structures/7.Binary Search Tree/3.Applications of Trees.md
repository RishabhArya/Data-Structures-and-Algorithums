<p>Unlike Array and Linked List, which are linear data structures, tree is hierarchical (or non-linear) data structure.</p>
<ol>
<li>One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer:<br>
file system<br>
———–</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>     /   &lt;-- root
  /      \
...        home
      /          \
   ugrad        course
    /          /    |    \
  ...        cs101 cs112 cs113
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
