<h1 id="graphs-data-structure">Graphs Data Structure</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes. It is a non-linear data structure.Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are used to represent networks.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.<br>
<strong>Representation</strong><br>
Following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> Adjacency Matrix<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Adjacency List<br>
<strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong><br>
Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph.If adj[i][j] = w, then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight w.<br>

Pros: Representation is easier to implement and follow. Removing an edge takes O(1) time. Queries like whether there is an edge from vertex ‘u’ to vertex ‘v’ are efficient and can be done O(1).<br>
<em>Cons:</em> Consumes more space O(V^2). Even if the graph is sparse(contains less number of edges), it consumes the same space. Adding a vertex is O(V^2) time.<br>
<strong>Adjacency List:</strong><br>
An array of lists is used. Size of the array is equal to the number of vertices. Let the array be array[]. An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the **<em>i</em>**th vertex.<br>
