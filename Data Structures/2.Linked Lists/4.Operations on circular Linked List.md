<h2 id="traversal">Traversal</h2>
<p>In a conventional linked list, we traverse the list from the head node and stop the traversal when we reach NULL. In a circular linked list, we stop traversal when we reach the first node again.</p>

<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Store the mid and last pointers of the circular linked list using <em><strong>tortoise</strong></em> and <em><strong>hare</strong></em> algorithm.</p>
<p><code>slow_ptr</code> <code>=</code> <code>self``.head</code><br>
<code>fast_ptr</code> <code>=</code> <code>self``.head</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the second half circular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the first half circular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set head (or start) pointers of the two linked lists.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sorted-insert-for-circular-linked-list">Sorted insert for circular linked list</h2>
<p>Allocate memory for the newly inserted node and put data in the newly allocated node. Let the pointer to the new node be new_node. After memory allocation, following are the three cases that need to be handled.</p>
<pre><code>1) _Linked List is empty:_  
a)  since new_node is the only node in CLL, make a self loop.      
      new_node-&gt;next = new_node;  
b) change the head pointer to point to new node.
      *head_ref = new_node;
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>New node is to be inserted just before the head node:</em><br>
(a) Find out the last node using a loop.<br>
while(current-&gt;next != *head_ref)<br>
current = current-&gt;next;<br>
(b) Change the next of last node.<br>
current-&gt;next = new_node;<br>
© Change next of new node to point to head.<br>
new_node-&gt;next = *head_ref;<br>
(d) change the head pointer to point to new node.<br>
*head_ref = new_node;</li>
<li><em>New node is to be  inserted somewhere after the head:</em><br>
(a) Locate the node after which new node is to be inserted.<br>
while ( current-&gt;next!= *head_ref &amp;&amp;<br>
current-&gt;next-&gt;data data)<br>
{   current = current-&gt;next;   }<br>
(b) Make next of new_node as next of the located pointer<br>
new_node-&gt;next = current-&gt;next;<br>
© Change the next of the located pointer<br>
current-&gt;next = new_node;</li>

<strong><em>Why have we taken a pointer that points to the last node instead of first node ?</em></strong><br>
For insertion of node in the beginning we need traverse the whole list. Also, for insertion and the end, the whole list has to be traversed. If instead of <em>start</em> pointer we take a pointer to the last node then in both the cases there won’t be any need to traverse the whole list. So insertion in the begging or at the end takes constant time irrespective of the length of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Insertion</strong><br>
A node can be added in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insertion in an empty list</li>
<li>Insertion at the beginning of the list</li>
<li>Insertion at the end of the list</li>
<li>Insertion in between the nodes</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea can be described using below steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a general purpose function that concatenates two given circular doubly lists (This function is explained below).</li>
<li>Now traverse the given tree<br>
….a) Recursively convert left subtree to a circular DLL. Let the converted list be leftList.<br>
….a) Recursively convert right subtree to a circular DLL. Let the converted list be rightList.<br>
….c) Make a circular linked list of root of the tree, make left and right of root to point to itself.<br>
….d) Concatenate leftList with list of single root node.<br>
….e) Concatenate the list produced in step above (d) with rightList.<br>
<strong>Case 1</strong>: List is empty.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the list is empty we will simply return.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong>:List is not empty</p>
<h2 id="deletion-from-a-circular-linked-list">Deletion from a Circular Linked List</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the list is not empty then we define two pointers <strong>curr</strong> and <strong>prev</strong> and initialize the pointer <strong>curr</strong> with the <strong>head</strong> node.</li>
<li>Traverse the list using <strong>curr</strong> to find the node to be deleted and before moving curr to next node, everytime set prev = curr.</li>
<li>If the node is found, check if it is the only node in the list. If yes, set head = NULL and free(curr).</li>
<li>If the list has more than one node, check if it is the first node of the list. Condition to check this( curr == head). If yes, then move prev until it reaches the last node. After prev reaches the last node, set head = head -&gt; next and prev -&gt; next = head. Delete curr.</li>
<li>If curr is not first node, we check if it is the last node in the list. Condition to check this is (curr -&gt; next == head).</li>
<li>If curr is the last node. Set prev -&gt; next = head and delete the node curr by free(curr).</li>
<li>If the node to be deleted is neither the first node nor the last node, then set prev -&gt; next = temp -&gt; next and delete curr.</li>
</ul>
