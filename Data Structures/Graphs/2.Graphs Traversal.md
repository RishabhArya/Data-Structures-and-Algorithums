<p>Breadth First Traversal for a graph is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles. To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.<br>

<h2 id="depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph">Depth First Search or DFS for a Graph</h2>
<p>Depth First Traversal  for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, a node may be visited twice. To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array.</p>
