<p>Stacks are a type of container adaptors with LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working, where a new element is added at one end and (top) an element is removed from that end only.</p>
<p>The functions associated with stack are:<br>
empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1)<br>
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)<br>
top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)<br>
push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)<br>
pop() – Deletes the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)</p>
<h2 id="stack-class-in-java">Stack Class in Java</h2>
<p>Java Collection framework provides a Stack class which models and implements Stack data structure. The class is based on the basic principle of last-in-first-out. In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of empty, search and peek.</p>
