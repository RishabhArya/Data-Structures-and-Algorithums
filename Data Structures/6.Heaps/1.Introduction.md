<h1 id="heap-introduction">Heap Introduction</h1>
<p>A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Max-Heap</strong>: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.</li>
<li><strong>Min-Heap</strong>: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="binary-heap">Binary Heap</h2>
<p>A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s a <strong>complete tree</strong> (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A  <strong>Binary Heap</strong>  is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="binary-tree-representation">Binary Tree Representation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The root element will be at Arr[0].</li>
<li>Below table shows indexes of other nodes for the ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:</li>
</ul>
<p>| Arr[(i-1)/2] Returns the parent node<br>
|  Arr[(2<em>i)+1]  Returns the left child node<br>
| Arr[(2</em>i)+2]  Returns the right child node<br>
<strong>Applications of Heaps:</strong><br>
<strong>1)</strong> <a href="http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/">Heap Sort</a>: Heap Sort uses Binary Heap to sort an array in O(nLogn) time.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Priority Queue: Priority queues can be efficiently implemented using Binary Heap because it supports insert(), delete() and extractmax(), decreaseKey() operations in O(logn) time. Binomoial Heap and Fibonacci Heap are variations of Binary Heap. These variations perform union also efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Graph Algorithms: The priority queues are especially used in Graph Algorithms like <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-7-dijkstras-algorithm-for-adjacency-list-representation/">Dijkstra’s Shortest Path</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-5-prims-minimum-spanning-tree-mst-2/">Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Many problems can be efficiently solved using Heaps. See following for example.<br>

b) <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nearly-sorted-algorithm/">Sort an almost sorted array/</a><br>
