<h1 id="binary-tree-data-structure">Binary Tree Data Structure</h1>
<p>A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.<br>

A Binary Tree node contains following parts.</p>

<strong>Trees:</strong> Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are <em><strong>hierarchical data structures.</strong></em><br>
<strong>Tree Vocabulary:</strong> The topmost node is called <em><strong>root</strong></em> of the tree. The elements that are directly under an element are called its <em><strong>children</strong></em>.<br>
<strong>Usage of Trees?</strong><br>
<strong>1.</strong> One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer:<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).<br>
<strong>4.</strong> Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.<br>
<strong>Main applications of trees include:</strong><br>
<strong>1.</strong> Manipulate hierarchical data.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Manipulate sorted lists of data.<br>
<strong>4.</strong> As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.<br>
<strong>5.</strong> Router algorithms<br>
<strong>6.</strong> Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).<br>
<strong>Binary Tree:</strong> A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.<br>
<strong>Binary Tree Representation in C:</strong> A tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in tree. If the tree is empty, then value of root is NULL.<br>

<h2 id="properties-of-binary-trees">Properties of Binary Trees</h2>
<p><strong>1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘0’ of a binary tree is 2<sup>l</sup></strong>.<br>
<strong>2) Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2<sup>h</sup> – 1</strong>.<br>
<strong>3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is ? Log2(N+1) ?</strong><br>
<strong>4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least ? Log2L ? + 1 levels</strong><br>
<strong>5) In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="handshaking-lemma">Handshaking Lemma</h2>
<p><strong>What is Handshaking Lemma?</strong><br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking_lemma">Handshaking lemma</a> is about undirected graph. In every finite undirected graph number of vertices with odd degree is always even. The handshaking lemma is a consequence of the degree sum formula (also sometimes called the handshaking lemma)<br>

<h2 id="types-of-binary-tree">Types of Binary Tree</h2>
<p><strong>1.Full Binary Tree</strong> A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaves have two children.<br>
<strong>In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1</strong><br>
L = I + 1<br>
Where L = Number of leaf nodes, I = Number of internal nodes<br>
<strong>2.Complete Binary Tree:</strong> A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible<br>
<strong>3.Perfect Binary Tree</strong> A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.<br>
<strong>4.Balanced Binary Tree</strong><br>
A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes</p>
<h2 id="enumeration-of-binary-trees">Enumeration of Binary Trees</h2>
<p>A Binary Tree is labeled if every node is assigned a label and a Binary Tree is unlabeled if nodes are not assigned any label.<br>
<strong>Catalan Number</strong><br>
n’th Catalan Number can also be evaluated using direct formula.<br>
T(n) = (2n)! / (n+1)!n!<br>
Number of Binary Search Trees (BST) with n nodes is also same as number of unlabeled trees.<br>
Number of Labeled Tees = (Number of unlabeled trees) * n!<br>
= [(2n)! / (n+1)!n!]  × n!</p>
