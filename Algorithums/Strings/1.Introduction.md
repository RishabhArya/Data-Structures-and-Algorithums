<h1 id="trie-introduction">Trie Introduction</h1>
<p>Trie is an efficient information re**<em>Trie</em>**val data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to <strong>M * log N</strong>, where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However the penalty is on Trie storage requirements<br>

<p>Every node of Trie consists of multiple branches. Each branch represents a possible character of keys. We need to mark the last node of every key as end of word node. A Trie node field <em>isEndOfWord</em> is used to distinguish the node as end of word node.</p>
<pre><code>`struct TrieNode  
{  
struct TrieNode *children[ALPHABET_SIZE];`

`// isEndOfWord is true if the node  
// represents end of a word  
bool isEndOfWord;  
};`
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>                       root
                    /   \    \
                    t   a     b
                    |   |     |
                    h   n     y
                    |   |  \  |
                    e   s  y  e
                 /  |   |
                 i  r   w
                 |  |   |
                 r  e   e
                        |
                        r
</code></pre>

<p>Insert and search costs <strong>O(key_length)</strong>, however the memory requirements of Trie is <strong>O(ALPHABET_SIZE * key_length * N)</strong> where N is number of keys in Trie.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-trie-data-structure">Advantages of Trie Data Structure</h2>
<p>Tries is a tree that stores strings. Maximum number of children of a node is equal to size of alphabet. Trie supports search, insert and delete operations in O(L) time where <strong>L</strong> is length of key.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>With Trie, we can insert and find strings in <strong><em>O(L)</em></strong> time where <em>L</em> represent the length of a single word. This is obviously faster than BST. This is also faster than Hashing because of the ways it is implemented. We do not need to compute any hash function. No collision handling is required (like we do in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-set-3-open-addressing/">open addressing</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-set-2-separate-chaining/">separate chaining</a>)</li>
<li>Another advantage of Trie is, we can <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-array-strings-words-using-trie/">easily print all words in alphabetical order</a> which is not easily possible with hashing.</li>
<li>We can efficiently do <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/auto-complete-feature-using-trie/">prefix search (or auto-complete) with Trie</a>.</li>
