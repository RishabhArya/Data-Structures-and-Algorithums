<h1 id="trie-introduction">Trie Introduction</h1>
<p>Trie is an efficient information re**<em>Trie</em>**val data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to <strong>M * log N</strong>, where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However the penalty is on Trie storage requirements<br>

<p>Every node of Trie consists of multiple branches. Each branch represents a possible character of keys. We need to mark the last node of every key as end of word node. A Trie node field <em>isEndOfWord</em> is used to distinguish the node as end of word node.</p>
<pre><code>`struct TrieNode  
{  
struct TrieNode *children[ALPHABET_SIZE];`

`// isEndOfWord is true if the node  
// represents end of a word  
bool isEndOfWord;  
};`
