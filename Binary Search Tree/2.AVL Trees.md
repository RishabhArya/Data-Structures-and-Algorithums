<h1 id="avl-trees">AVL Trees</h1>
<p>What if the input to binary search tree comes in a sorted (ascending or descending) manner? It will then look like this −<br>

<strong>Why AVL Trees?</strong><br>
Most of the BST operations (e.g., search, max, min, insert, delete… etc) take O(h) time where h is the height of the BST. The cost of these operations may become O(n) for a skewed Binary tree. If we make sure that height of the tree remains O(Logn) after every insertion and deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(Logn) for all these operations. The height of an AVL tree is always O(Logn) where n is the number of nodes in the tree</p>
<p>It is observed that BST’s worst-case performance is closest to linear search algorithms, that is Ο(n). In real-time data, we cannot predict data pattern and their frequencies. So, a need arises to balance out the existing BST<br>
AVL tree checks the height of the left and the right sub-trees and assures that the difference is not more than 1. This difference is called the <strong>Balance Factor</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>BalanceFactor</strong></em> = height(left-sutree) − height(right-sutree)<br>
If the difference in the height of left and right sub-trees is more than 1, the tree is balanced using some rotation techniques.</p>

<h2 id="avl-rotations">AVL Rotations</h2>
<p>To balance itself, an AVL tree may perform the following four kinds of rotations −</p>
<ul>
<li>Left rotation</li>
<li>Right rotation</li>
<li>Left-Right rotation</li>
<li>Right-Left rotation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="left-rotation">Left Rotation</h3>
<p>If a tree becomes unbalanced, when a node is inserted into the right subtree of the right subtree, then we perform a single left rotation −<br>

<h3 id="right-rotation">Right Rotation</h3>
<p>AVL tree may become unbalanced, if a node is inserted in the left subtree of the left subtree. The tree then needs a right rotation.<br>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/avl_right_rotation.jpg" alt="Right Rotation"></p>
<h3 id="left-right-rotation">Left-Right Rotation</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/right_subtree_of_left_subtree.jpg" alt="Right Rotation"></p>
<p>A node has been inserted into the right subtree of the left subtree. This makes <strong>C</strong> an unbalanced node. These scenarios cause AVL tree to perform left-right rotation.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/subtree_left_rotation.jpg" alt="Left Rotation"></p>
<p>We first perform the left rotation on the left subtree of <strong>C</strong>. This makes <strong>A</strong>, the left subtree of <strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/left_unbalanced_tree.jpg" alt="Left Rotation"></p>
<p>Node <strong>C</strong> is still unbalanced, however now, it is because of the left-subtree of the left-subtree.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/right_rotation.jpg" alt="Right Rotation"></p>
<p>We shall now right-rotate the tree, making <strong>B</strong> the new root node of this subtree. <strong>C</strong> now becomes the right subtree of its own left subtree.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/balanced_avl_tree.jpg" alt="Balanced Avl Tree"></p>
<p>The tree is now balanced.</p>
<h3 id="right-left-rotation">Right-Left Rotation</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/left_subtree_of_right_subtree.jpg" alt="Left Subtree of Right Subtree"></p>
<p>A node has been inserted into the left subtree of the right subtree. This makes <strong>A</strong>, an unbalanced node with balance factor 2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/subtree_right_rotation.jpg" alt="Subtree Right Rotation"></p>
<p>First, we perform the right rotation along <strong>C</strong> node, making <strong>C</strong> the right subtree of its own left subtree <strong>B</strong>. Now, <strong>B</strong> becomes the right subtree of <strong>A</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/right_unbalanced_tree.jpg" alt="Right Unbalanced Tree"></p>
<p>Node <strong>A</strong> is still unbalanced because of the right subtree of its right subtree and requires a left rotation.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/left_rotation.jpg" alt="Left Rotation"></p>
<p>A left rotation is performed by making <strong>B</strong> the new root node of the subtree. <strong>A</strong> becomes the left subtree of its right subtree <strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/balanced_avl_tree.jpg" alt="Balanced AVL Tree"></p>
<p>The tree is now balanced.</p>
