<h1 id="binary-search-tree">Binary Search Tree</h1>
<p><strong>Binary Search Tree</strong> is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.</li>
<li>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.</li>
<li>The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The above properties of Binary Search Tree provide an ordering among keys so that the operations like search, minimum and maximum can be done fast. If there is no ordering, then we may have to compare every key to search a given key.</strong><br>

<strong>Searching a key</strong><br>
For searching a value, if we had a sorted array we could have performed a binary search. Let’s say we want to search a number in the array what we do in binary search is we first define the complete list as our search space, the number can exist only within the search space. Now we compare the number to be searched or the element to be searched with the mid element of the search space or the median and if the record being searched is lesser we go searching in the left half else we go searching in the right half, in case of equality we have found the element. In binary search we start with <strong>‘n’</strong> elements in search space and then if mid element is not the element that we are looking for, we reduce the search space to <strong>‘n/2’</strong> and we go on reducing the search space till we either find the record that we are looking for or we get to only one element in search space and be done with this whole reduction.<br>
<strong>Insertion of a key</strong><br>
A new key is always inserted at leaf. We start searching a key from root till we hit a leaf node. Once a leaf node is found, the new node is added as a child of the leaf node.</p>
<pre><code>     100                               100
    /   \        Insert 40            /    \
  20     500    ---------&gt;          20     500 
 /  \                              /  \  
10   30                           10   30
                                          \   
                                          40

<p><strong>Some Interesting Facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inorder traversal of BST always produces sorted output.</li>
<li>We can construct a BST with only Preorder or Postorder or Level Order traversal. Note that we can always get inorder traversal by sorting the only given traversal.</li>
<li>Number of unique BSTs with n distinct keys is Catalan Number</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="advantages-of-bst-over-hash-table">Advantages of BST over Hash Table</h1>
<p>Hash Table supports following operations in Θ(1) time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Insert</li>
<li>Delete</li>
</ol>
<p>The time complexity of above operations in a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST)(like Red-Black Tree ,AVL Tree , Splay Tree, etc) is O(Logn).</p>
<ol>
<li>We can get all keys in sorted order by just doing Inorder Traversal of BST. This is not a natural operation in Hash Tables and requires extra efforts.</li>
<li>Doing order statistics , finding closest lower and greater elements doing range queries are easy to do with BSTs. Like sorting, these operations are not a natural operation with Hash Tables.</li>
<li>BSTs are easy to implement compared to hashing, we can easily implement our own customized BST. To implement Hashing, we generally rely on libraries provided by programming languages.</li>
<li>With Self-Balancing BSTs, all operations are guaranteed to work in O(Logn) time. But with Hashing, Θ(1) is average time and some particular operations may be costly, especially when table resizing happens.</li>

<h2 id="binary-search-tree-deletion">Binary Search Tree Deletion</h2>
<p><strong>1) <em>Node to be deleted is leaf:</em></strong> Simply remove from the tree.<br>
<strong>2) <em>Node to be deleted has only one child:</em></strong> Copy the child to the node and delete the child<br>
<strong>3) <em>Node to be deleted has two children:</em></strong> Find inorder successor of the node. Copy contents of the inorder successor to the node and delete the inorder successor. Note that inorder predecessor can also be used.</p>
<h2 id="handling-duplicates-in-binary-search-tree">Handling duplicates in Binary Search Tree</h2>
<p>A <strong>Good  Solution</strong> is to augment every tree node to store count together with regular fields like key, left and right pointers.<br>
Insertion of keys 12, 10, 20, 9, 11, 10, 12, 12 in an empty Binary Search Tree would create following.</p>
<pre><code>         12(3)
       /        \
     10(2)      20(1)
    /    \       
 9(1)    11(1)   
</code></pre>
<p>Count of a key is shown in bracket</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Height of tree is small irrespective of number of duplicates. Note that most of the BST operations (search, insert and delete) have time complexity as O(h) where h is height of BST. So if we are able to keep the height small, we get advantage of less number of key comparisons.<br>
<strong>2)</strong> Search, Insert and Delete become easier to do. We can use same insert, search and delete algorithms with small modifications (see below code).<br>
<strong>3)</strong> This approach is suited for self-balancing BSTs (AVL Tree, Red-Black, Tree etc) also. These trees involve rotations, and a rotation may violate BST property of simple solution as a same key can be in either left side or right side after rotation.</p>
